Our script collection has been included for artists' use, reference, and convenience. <br>

*directoryCopies.py in the /temp directory controls directory copies, as the name suggests.<BR>
*install_scripts.ms controls individual file operations.<BR><BR>

INSTRUCTIONS<BR><BR>
1) First, copy all script files that you want to install and the directoryCopies.py to C:/Users/<User>/AppData/Local/Autodesk/3dsMax/<Version> - 64bit/ENU/temp. (Alternatively, you can unzip temp.zip and temp2.zip to that location.<BR>
2) Adjust install_scripts.ms and the directoryCopies.py to coincide with YOUR script files. Otherwise, you'll end up with our script collection installed.<BR>
3) IMPORTANT: UPDATE YOUR VERSION OF MAX on the Line 11 of the directoryCopies.py file. Failure to do so will cause tool failure.
